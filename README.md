## Improvements
- Higher success rate in dense/complicated environments.  
- Simpler problem formulation.  
- Candidate result when no collision-free solution exists.  
## Simulation

## Dependencies  
<!-- :atom: TO BE UPDATED.  
For now, refer to ðŸ‘‰[path_optimizer](https://github.com/LiJiangnanBit/path_optimizer). It's generally the same.   -->  
- ROS2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04) or Humble (Ubuntu 22.04);  
- Other dependencies: [glog](https://github.com/google/glog),  [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags), [osqp-eigen](https://github.com/robotology/osqp-eigen), [grid_map (ros2 branch)](https://github.com/ANYbotics/grid_map)  
-  Put these ROS packages in your ros workspace:  [ros2_viz_tools](https://github.com/GPrathap/ros_viz_tools), [tinyspline_ros](https://github.com/GPrathap/tinyspline_ros.git).  
These dependencies (except for ROS) can be installed by running script/install_deps.sh.  
## Usage
A png image is loaded as the grid map. You can click to specify the global reference path and the start/goal state of the vehicle.  
~~~
ros2 launch path_optimizer_2 demo.launch.py
~~~
#### (1) Pick reference points using "Publish Point" tool in RViz.  
- Pick at least six points.  
- There are no hard and fast rules about the spacing of the points.  
- If you want to abandon the chosen points, just double click anywhere when using the "Publish Point" tool.  
- You can replace `gridmap.png` with other black and white images. Note that the resolution in `demo.cpp` is set to 0.2m, whick means that the length of one pixel is 0.2m on the map.  
- In application, the reference path is given by a global path or by a search algorithm like A*.

#### (2) Pick start state using "2D Pose Estimate" tool and pick goal state using "2D Nav Goal" tool.  
- Currently, it's not strictly required to reach the goal state. But this can be changed.    
- The start state must be ahead of the first reference point.
